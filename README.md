""" Manipulating data using loops and array iterations to solve the exercise.

1- Breaking down the problem into smaller chunks, extracting the relevant data, 
   as demonstrated by Rafael Procopio on the Matem√°tica Rio channel;

2- To begin, we'll instantiate an array to hold data for 10 distinct individuals;

3- Each person will be assigned at least a name and an email address for identification purposes;

4 - Some of these individuals are employees and will consequently hold a position within the rock band, for exemple;

5 - I iterate through this array of people;

6 - I implement a method to comprehensively format the attributes of each person and subsequently call it(full_informations);

7 - Then I print all this organized information to my computer screen.
